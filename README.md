# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview:

Accountability Accounting, a investment bank, is looking at offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  However, they needs to research about the cryptocurrency market before launching their new business plan.  This analysis was conducted to present what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.  Since the output was unknown in advance, unsupervised learning was used for this analysis.    

The following processes were taken for this analysis:

1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA

2. Reducing Data Dimensions (dimensionality reduction) Using PCA 

3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means

4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results and Summary:

Based on the clustering algorithm, there are 4 clusters.  Although it is hard to see the clusters in 2D scatter since the scatters are ovelapped each other, 3D scatter shows that the dataset of the class 0 and 3 are similar.
