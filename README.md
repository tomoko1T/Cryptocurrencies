# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview:

Accountability Accounting, a investment bank, was looking at offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  However, they needed to research about the cryptocurrency market before launching their new business plan.  This analysis was conducted to present what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment.  Since the output of this analysis was unknown in advance, unsupervised learning was employed following the steps below. 

1. Preprocessing the Data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

2. Reducing Data Dimensions (dimensionality reduction) using PCA 

3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies using K-means

4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Results and Summary:

Based on the clustering algorithm, there are 4 clusters.  The total number of tradable cyptocurrencies is 532.  While the classes in 2D scatter graph are not visualized well since they are ovelapped each other, 3D scatter graph shows that the dataset of class 0 and 3 are similar.
